# Heritage Harvest Recipes: Rediscovering Culinary Roots - An AI Generated Astro Site

This Astro site was generated by an AI assistant for AstroHost.

## Theme & Objective
Discover and share forgotten recipes! A community cookbook celebrating heritage dishes and culinary traditions from around the world.
User Prompt: Create a warm and inviting website called 'Heritage Harvest Recipes'. The site is dedicated to preserving and sharing traditional family recipes from different cultures. The target audience is home cooks and food enthusiasts interested in heritage cuisine. The aesthetic should be rustic and vintage-inspired, with warm colors and hand-drawn elements. Key sections include a recipe submission portal, a browseable recipe index (filterable by region, ingredient, or cuisine), a blog with stories behind the recipes, and an 'about us' section detailing the project's mission. Consider including a feature for users to upload photos of their dishes and share family anecdotes.

## Setup & Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install 
    # or yarn install, or pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser at `http://localhost:4321` (or the port Astro assigns).

3.  **Build for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The static files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to Cloudflare Pages or other static hosts.

## Images
The articles currently use placeholder images from `https://placehold.co`. You should replace these with actual images relevant to your content.
The frontmatter of each article in `src/content/blog/` contains an `image` field with a `dataAiHint` attribute:
```yaml
image:
  url: 'https://placehold.co/800x400.png' # Update this to /images/your-image.jpg after placing it in public/images
  alt: 'Descriptive alt text for your image'   # Update this
  dataAiHint: 'relevant keywords' # This hint describes the intended image. Use it to find or generate a replacement.
```
Place your actual images in the `public/images/` directory and update the `url` in the frontmatter to be like `/images/your-image.jpg`.

## Cloudflare Pages Compatibility
This site is configured for static output by default (`output: 'static'` in `astro.config.mjs`), making it ready for deployment on Cloudflare Pages.
If SSR with Cloudflare was explicitly requested and the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter is included in `astro.config.mjs` and `package.json`, follow Cloudflare's instructions for deploying Astro SSR sites.

## Customization
- Explore `src/pages/` for page structure.
- Modify layouts in `src/layouts/`.
- Add or edit components in `src/components/`.
- Blog posts are in `src/content/blog/` (MDX or Markdown).
- Site configuration is in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Dependencies are in `package.json`.
- Tailwind CSS configuration is in `tailwind.config.mjs`.
- Global styles (if any beyond Tailwind) could be added in `src/styles/global.css` and imported in `BaseLayout.astro`.

Happy coding with your AI-generated Astro site!
